# NeverRun - Prague live transport map

[NeverRun](http://neverrun.github.io) is for everybody who commutes daily with public transport. It shows the position of transport vehicles all around you.. Now you know if you should rush to catch a metro train or relax instead.
We used data supplied by Magistrát hl. m. Prahy in order to simulate live server giving us position data of all means of transport. City of Prague is planning to launch a real server soon - and our app will be ready!
