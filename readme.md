# NeverRun - Prague live transport map

[NeverRun](http://neverrun.github.io) is for everybody who commutes daily with public transport. It shows the position of transport vehicles all around you.. Now you know if you should rush to catch a metro train or relax instead.
We used data supplied by Magistr√°t hl. m. Prahy in order to simulate live server giving us position data of all means of transport. City of Prague is planning to launch a real server soon - and our app will be ready!
